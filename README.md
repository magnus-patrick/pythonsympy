# SymPy üêç

- $$SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.
- It is great at analytical computation but for numeric computation, SciPy is more optimal.
- It can do algebraic problems such as solving equations, factoring, & expanding them.
- It can also do calculus, namely integration, differentiation, and Taylor/Maclaurin series. Vector calculus is also possible.
- It can create matrices similar to NumPy's array function. It can also do vector & matrix operations such as the dot and cross product and calculate projections.$$
